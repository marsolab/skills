## SaaS Landing Page Workflow

The difference between typing words onto rectangles and running a knowledge-generating machine.

### Phase 1: Define Strategy & Positioning

This is where we decide what the page is trying to do and for whom. Skipping this phase is how beautiful garbage gets made.

**Define:**
- ICP (ideal customer profile)
- Job To Be Done
- Pain → Desired outcome
- Awareness level (Schwartz)
- Primary CTA
- Single conversion event (signup, demo, waitlist, trial)

**Strategy Brief Template:**

```
Audience:
Primary pain:
Desired outcome:
Main value proposition:
Alternative solutions today:
Primary CTA:
Secondary CTA:
Key objections:
Non-negotiable proof:
```

The page exists to serve that brief.

### Phase 2: Voice-of-Customer Research (VOC)

Pros don't invent copy. They harvest it from real humans.

**Sources:**
- Support tickets
- Sales call transcripts
- Reviews (G2, Capterra, App stores)
- Competitor reviews (goldmine)
- User interviews

**Extract:**
- Exact phrases about pain
- Desired outcomes
- Anxieties and objections
- Buying triggers

**Message Bank Format:**

| Theme | Quote | Source | Awareness Stage | Notes |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

Patterns will emerge like constellations in a nerdy night sky.

### Phase 3: Build the Message Architecture

Translate VOC into structured narrative.

**SaaS-Optimized Structure:**
1. Hero = Value Proposition + Who it's for
2. Context/Problem setup
3. Outcome (not features yet)
4. How it works
5. Social proof
6. Objection handling
7. CTA
8. Risk removal
9. Footer safety net CTA

If it does not help conversion or clarity, it is atmospheric noise.

**Writing Standards:**
- Avoid slogans ("Reinventing the future of work" = meaningless word fog)
- Prefer descriptive clarity ("Analytics that alert you when churn risk spikes")
- Clarity > Poetry. Always.

### Phase 4: Layout & Design Decisions

Typography, spacing, and hierarchy earn their keep here.

**Design Heuristics:**
- One primary CTA color — consistent throughout
- Remove navigation unless needed
- 45–75 character line lengths
- Body text ≥ 16px
- Contrast ratio ≥ WCAG AA
- Avoid center-aligned paragraphs (except short blocks)

**Hero Checklist (3-Second Test):**
- What is this?
- Who is it for?
- Why should I care now?

If the hero doesn't answer these, back to the lab.

### Phase 5: Wireframe First

Lo-fi wireframes before fancy visuals. Discipline over decoration.

**Tools:**
- FigJam / Figma
- Whimsical
- Miro
- Paper (yes, real trees)

**Process:**
1. Work in grayscale first
2. Typography next
3. Color last

This stops design from distracting you from structure.

### Phase 6: Build the First Version

Ship fast because data beats theory.

**Build Tools:**
- [Webflow](https://webflow.com/)
- [Framer](https://www.framer.com/)
- [Unbounce](https://unbounce.com/)

**Instrument Before Launch:**
- [GA4](https://analytics.google.com/)
- [Microsoft Clarity](https://clarity.microsoft.com/)
- Chat widget (Crisp/Intercom) — optional

**Set up:**
- Events
- Funnels
- Goals

Otherwise you're driving at night without headlights.

### Phase 7: Form a Hypothesis Backlog

We do not "try stuff." We test hypotheses.

**Hypothesis Format:**

```
If we: [change]
Then: [expected outcome]
Because: [evidence/reasoning]
Measured by: [metric]
Success criteria: [threshold]
Risk: [low/medium/high]
Effort: [low/medium/high]
```

**Example:**
```
If we: add outcome-focused headline using VOC language
Then: more visitors will start the signup flow
Because: users say benefit X is the main reason they buy
Measured by: signup CTA clicks
Success criteria: +15% vs control
Risk: low
Effort: low
```

**Prioritize by ICE Score:**
- **I**mpact
- **C**onfidence
- **E**ffort

Start with high ICE, low effort. Warm up conversions like stretching before a workout.

### Phase 8: A/B Testing & Experimentation

**Testing Tools:**
- [VWO](https://vwo.com/)
- [Convert](https://www.convert.com/)
- [SplitSignal](https://splitsignal.io/) (Ahrefs)

**Clean Experiment Rules:**
- One variable at a time
- Pre-define success metrics
- Ensure sample size can reach significance
- Avoid peeking biases

**Low Traffic Alternative:**
Use sequential learning + qualitative feedback instead of strict A/B.

### Phase 9: Analyze & Document Learnings

Pros ship reports, not vibes.

**Learning Report Structure:**
- Hypothesis
- Control vs Variant
- Result significance
- Behavioral insights
- What we learned

Store in a shared repo so knowledge compounds. Your company becomes a memory organism rather than a goldfish.

### Phase 10: Continuous Optimization Loop

Great landing pages are garden ecosystems, not statues.

**Continually Refine:**
- Positioning
- Messaging
- Interaction friction
- Pricing clarity
- Trust signals

Like a scientific practice — endlessly curious, never fully satisfied.

## Conversion Mindset

Professionals think in systems, not tactics.

**Key Questions:**
- What belief must change for a user to act?
- What proof supports that belief shift?
- What friction exists in the journey?
- What signals show trust and safety?
- What story are we telling?

And then they test reality. Because reality always has a punchline.

## Hormozi Value Framework

Alex Hormozi treats copywriting as engineering the perception of value. Without an irresistible offer, good writing alone won't convert.

### The Value Equation

```
Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Achievement)
        ÷ (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

The goal of your copy is to maximize perceived value and minimize perceived cost.

**Apply to every section:**
- **Dream Outcome** — Speak to the specific result customers deeply want (e.g., "$100K revenue increase", not "better marketing")
- **Perceived Likelihood** — Back the promise with proof: testimonials, case studies, authority signals, guarantees
- **Time Delay** — Stress speed to result (e.g., "90-day plan" vs "months of effort")
- **Effort & Sacrifice** — Reduce friction: show how little effort the customer must exert

### Core Copy Philosophy

**Sell the Outcome, Not the Features**

People don't care about features — they care about transformation. Your copy should articulate:
- Where the visitor is now
- The pain they feel
- The after-state when they take action

This drives the emotional hook.

**"The Pain Is the Pitch"**

Lead with the pain — describe the exact moment someone feels the problem (not vague generalities). This makes your message felt before it's believed.

### Headline Strategy

Headlines do 80% of the conversion work. If people aren't intrigued immediately, nothing else matters.

**Headline Formula:**
```
Get [Specific Result] in [Timeframe] With Less [Pain/Effort]
```

**Requirements:**
- Short
- Clear
- Outcome-oriented
- Undeniably valuable and specific

### Offer Design = Copy

Copy isn't separate from offer design — they're the same system. What marketers call "good copy" is actually a good offer expressed well.

**Offer Engineering:**
- Include stacked value elements (bonuses, guarantees, support)
- Break your offer into distinct benefits rather than one vague promise
- Price should anchor to value delivered, not cost incurred

### Landing Page Application

**Hero Section:**
- Dream outcome + perceived likelihood + low friction
- Above the fold = outcome + proof signal

**Proof & Credibility:**
- Social proof, quantified results, specific use cases
- All increase perceived likelihood of achievement

**Pain Breakdown:**
- Illustrate the felt experience of the visitor's problem
- Not abstract description — emotional specificity

**Offer Stack (Value Stacking):**
- Instead of one deliverable, present components that each deliver value
- Primary benefit + bonuses + guarantee

**Timing & Scarcity:**
- Position the timeline concretely ("Join before X to guarantee start in Q1")
- Reduces perceived delay

### Copy Techniques

**Direct, no-fluff hooks:**
- Use very specific benefits
- Avoid generic claims ("best", "top", "great")
- Short hooks with numbers or concrete contrasts

**Speak in client language:**
- Talk about the exact pains and desires your audience uses themselves
- Not jargon — resonates because it feels like someone finally gets them

### Key Takeaways

- Copy is offer articulation. If your offer isn't genuinely compelling under the value equation, no words will fix it
- Emotional specificity and pain narrative kill generic language
- Headlines carry massive conversion weight — treat them as the first hypothesis to test
- Use the value equation as a heuristic: make value feel greater than cost on every element

## When Helping Users

1. **Ask about positioning first** - Who is this for? What alternatives exist? Why choose this?
2. **Request customer voice** - Reviews, testimonials, support tickets, interview transcripts
3. **Understand the funnel stage** - Awareness level determines message sophistication
4. **Identify the primary objection** - What stops people from converting?
5. **Define success metrics** - What does "working" look like?

You approach every project as a curious, lab-coat-wearing conversion scientist. You stop guessing. You test. You learn. You iterate.
